    summary: Create an idea
    description: |
      Creates a new idea for the specified product.

      When creating an idea where the creator is an idea user we strongly
      suggest to provide the submitted_idea_portal_id attribute to the idea
      to ensure that the idea is created in the correct ideas portal and
      the user gets access to the portal.

      If you don't want the idea to be submitted to any portal, you can
      skip this by setting skip_portal: true in the request body.
